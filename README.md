# TEXture Analysis of CT and PET in NSLC cancer patients treated with Stereotactic body radiation therapy (TEXAS study)
The aim of this study is to analyze different models based on radiomic features to predict disease relapse from pre-SBRT imaging.
In this repository, you will find two different trained models (linear SVM and ensemble subspace discriminant) in MATLAB workspace format (.mat). The training has been performed on 76 patients from 3 different centres and the models have been validated on 41 patients from 4 other centres. The interested reader can find more details in Bertolini et al., Novel harmonization method for multi-centric radiomic studies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (submitted. DOI will be provided upon publication).

How to use these models:


We advise to use this model when dealing with NSCLC patients, as detailed in our article as other lung cancer diseases have not been tested or explored. We believe in trasparency and free science as our vision for this project, thus the sharing of our models' weights publicy. If you use it for validation in your patient cohort, please let us know (valeria.trojani@ausl.re.it) and cite the following article Bertolini et al., Novel harmonization method for multi-centric radiomic studies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (submitted. DOI will be provided upon publication) in your work. Feedback, comments and questions are also welcome at the above address.
